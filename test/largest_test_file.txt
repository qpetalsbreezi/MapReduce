bring plenty of water. “A beautiful hike to the clouds” described one review. “Not for the faint-hearted,” said another. “Not 
too bad of a workout”, bragged a third review. I thought I’d hike it when I fly in from Maryland 
on my day off from the senior citizen's wellness conference. I hiked 2 miles a day around the neighborhood so 
I could handle a 1.1-mile hike. What a foolish mistake that was for a 70-year-old low-lander. It's always good to
 bring a slower friend with you on a hike. If you happen to come across bears, the whole group doesn't 
have to worry. Only the slowest in the group do. That was the lesson they were about to learn today.
He stared out the window at the snowy field. He'd been stuck in the house for close to a month
 and his only view of the outside world was through the window. There wasn't much to see. It was mostly
 just the field with an occasional bird or small animal who ventured into the field. As he continued to stare
out the window, he wondered how much longer he'd be shackled to the steel bar inside the house. Life isn't
 always beautiful. That was a lesson that Dan was learning. He also realized that life wasn't easy. This had come
 as a shock since he had lived a charmed life. He hated that this was the truth and he struggled
 to be happy knowing that his assumptions weren't correct. He wouldn't realize until much later in life that the difficult 
obstacles he was facing that were taking away the beauty in his life at this moment would ultimately make his
 life much more beautiful. All he knew was that at this moment was that life isn't always beautiful. Hopes and 
dreams were dashed that day. It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock. The warning signs
 had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. That possibility had grown from 
hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came
 crashing down. The trail to the left had a "Danger! Do Not Pass" sign telling people to take the trail
 to the right. This wasn't the way Zeke approached his hiking. Rather than a warning, Zeke read the sign as
 an invitation to explore an area that would be adventurous and exciting. As the others in the group all shifted
 to the right, Zeke slipped past the danger sign to begin an adventure he would later regret. Trees. It was
 something about the trees. The way they swayed with the wind in unison. The way they shaded the area around
 them. The sounds of their leaves in the wind and the creaks from the branches as they sway, the beauty.

too bad of a workout”, bragged a third review. I thought I’d hike it when I fly in from Maryland 
on my day off from the senior citizen's wellness conference. I hiked 2 miles a day around the neighborhood so 
I could handle a 1.1-mile hike. What a foolish mistake that was for a 70-year-old low-lander. It's always good to
 bring a slower friend with you on a hike. If you happen to come across bears, the whole group doesn't 
have to worry. Only the slowest in the group do. That was the lesson they were about to learn today.
He stared out the window at the snowy field. He'd been stuck in the house for close to a month
 and his only view of the outside world was through the window. There wasn't much to see. It was mostly
 just the field with an occasional bird or small animal who ventured into the field. As he continued to stare
out the window, he wondered how much longer he'd be shackled to the steel bar inside the house. Life isn't
 always beautiful. That was a lesson that Dan was learning. He also realized that life wasn't easy. This had come
 as a shock since he had lived a charmed life. He hated that this was the truth and he struggled
 to be happy knowing that his assumptions weren't correct. He wouldn't realize until much later in life that the difficult 
obstacles he was facing that were taking away the beauty in his life at this moment would ultimately make his
 life much more beautiful. All he knew was that at this moment was that life isn't always beautiful. Hopes and 
dreams were dashed that day. It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock. The warning signs
 had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. That possibility had grown from 
hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came
 crashing down. The trail to the left had a "Danger! Do Not Pass" sign telling people to take the trail
 to the right. This wasn't the way Zeke approached his hiking. Rather than a warning, Zeke read the sign as
 an invitation to explore an area that would be adventurous and exciting. As the others in the group all shifted
 to the right, Zeke slipped past the danger sign to begin an adventure he would later regret. Trees. It was
 something about the trees. The way they swayed with the wind in unison. The way they shaded the area around
 them. The sounds of their leaves in the wind and the creaks from the branches as they sway, the beauty.

too bad of a workout”, bragged a third review. I thought I’d hike it when I fly in from Maryland 
on my day off from the senior citizen's wellness conference. I hiked 2 miles a day around the neighborhood so 
I could handle a 1.1-mile hike. What a foolish mistake that was for a 70-year-old low-lander. It's always good to
 bring a slower friend with you on a hike. If you happen to come across bears, the whole group doesn't 
have to worry. Only the slowest in the group do. That was the lesson they were about to learn today.
He stared out the window at the snowy field. He'd been stuck in the house for close to a month
 and his only view of the outside world was through the window. There wasn't much to see. It was mostly
 just the field with an occasional bird or small animal who ventured into the field. As he continued to stare
out the window, he wondered how much longer he'd be shackled to the steel bar inside the house. Life isn't
 always beautiful. That was a lesson that Dan was learning. He also realized that life wasn't easy. This had come
 as a shock since he had lived a charmed life. He hated that this was the truth and he struggled
 to be happy knowing that his assumptions weren't correct. He wouldn't realize until much later in life that the difficult 
obstacles he was facing that were taking away the beauty in his life at this moment would ultimately make his
 life much more beautiful. All he knew was that at this moment was that life isn't always beautiful. Hopes and 
dreams were dashed that day. It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock. The warning signs
 had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. That possibility had grown from 
hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came
 crashing down. The trail to the left had a "Danger! Do Not Pass" sign telling people to take the trail
 to the right. This wasn't the way Zeke approached his hiking. Rather than a warning, Zeke read the sign as
 an invitation to explore an area that would be adventurous and exciting. As the others in the group all shifted
 to the right, Zeke slipped past the danger sign to begin an adventure he would later regret. Trees. It was
 something about the trees. The way they swayed with the wind in unison. The way they shaded the area around
 them. The sounds of their leaves in the wind and the creaks from the branches as they sway, the beauty.

too bad of a workout”, bragged a third review. I thought I’d hike it when I fly in from Maryland 
on my day off from the senior citizen's wellness conference. I hiked 2 miles a day around the neighborhood so 
I could handle a 1.1-mile hike. What a foolish mistake that was for a 70-year-old low-lander. It's always good to
 bring a slower friend with you on a hike. If you happen to come across bears, the whole group doesn't 
have to worry. Only the slowest in the group do. That was the lesson they were about to learn today.
He stared out the window at the snowy field. He'd been stuck in the house for close to a month
 and his only view of the outside world was through the window. There wasn't much to see. It was mostly
 just the field with an occasional bird or small animal who ventured into the field. As he continued to stare
out the window, he wondered how much longer he'd be shackled to the steel bar inside the house. Life isn't
 always beautiful. That was a lesson that Dan was learning. He also realized that life wasn't easy. This had come
 as a shock since he had lived a charmed life. He hated that this was the truth and he struggled
 to be happy knowing that his assumptions weren't correct. He wouldn't realize until much later in life that the difficult 
obstacles he was facing that were taking away the beauty in his life at this moment would ultimately make his
 life much more beautiful. All he knew was that at this moment was that life isn't always beautiful. Hopes and 
dreams were dashed that day. It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock. The warning signs
 had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. That possibility had grown from 
hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came
 crashing down. The trail to the left had a "Danger! Do Not Pass" sign telling people to take the trail
 to the right. This wasn't the way Zeke approached his hiking. Rather than a warning, Zeke read the sign as
 an invitation to explore an area that would be adventurous and exciting. As the others in the group all shifted
 to the right, Zeke slipped past the danger sign to begin an adventure he would later regret. Trees. It was
 something about the trees. The way they swayed with the wind in unison. The way they shaded the area around
 them. The sounds of their leaves in the wind and the creaks from the branches as they sway, the beauty.

too bad of a workout”, bragged a third review. I thought I’d hike it when I fly in from Maryland 
on my day off from the senior citizen's wellness conference. I hiked 2 miles a day around the neighborhood so 
I could handle a 1.1-mile hike. What a foolish mistake that was for a 70-year-old low-lander. It's always good to
 bring a slower friend with you on a hike. If you happen to come across bears, the whole group doesn't 
have to worry. Only the slowest in the group do. That was the lesson they were about to learn today.
He stared out the window at the snowy field. He'd been stuck in the house for close to a month
 and his only view of the outside world was through the window. There wasn't much to see. It was mostly
 just the field with an occasional bird or small animal who ventured into the field. As he continued to stare
out the window, he wondered how much longer he'd be shackled to the steel bar inside the house. Life isn't
 always beautiful. That was a lesson that Dan was learning. He also realized that life wasn't easy. This had come
 as a shock since he had lived a charmed life. He hated that this was the truth and he struggled
 to be happy knowing that his assumptions weren't correct. He wouldn't realize until much later in life that the difficult 
obstacles he was facing that were taking away the beauty in his life at this moment would ultimately make his
 life much more beautiful. All he knew was that at this moment was that life isn't always beautiful. Hopes and 
dreams were dashed that day. It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock. The warning signs
 had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. That possibility had grown from 
hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came
 crashing down. The trail to the left had a "Danger! Do Not Pass" sign telling people to take the trail
 to the right. This wasn't the way Zeke approached his hiking. Rather than a warning, Zeke read the sign as
 an invitation to explore an area that would be adventurous and exciting. As the others in the group all shifted
 to the right, Zeke slipped past the danger sign to begin an adventure he would later regret. Trees. It was
 something about the trees. The way they swayed with the wind in unison. The way they shaded the area around
 them. The sounds of their leaves in the wind and the creaks from the branches as they sway, the beauty.

too bad of a workout”, bragged a third review. I thought I’d hike it when I fly in from Maryland 
on my day off from the senior citizen's wellness conference. I hiked 2 miles a day around the neighborhood so 
I could handle a 1.1-mile hike. What a foolish mistake that was for a 70-year-old low-lander. It's always good to
 bring a slower friend with you on a hike. If you happen to come across bears, the whole group doesn't 
have to worry. Only the slowest in the group do. That was the lesson they were about to learn today.
He stared out the window at the snowy field. He'd been stuck in the house for close to a month
 and his only view of the outside world was through the window. There wasn't much to see. It was mostly
 just the field with an occasional bird or small animal who ventured into the field. As he continued to stare
out the window, he wondered how much longer he'd be shackled to the steel bar inside the house. Life isn't
 always beautiful. That was a lesson that Dan was learning. He also realized that life wasn't easy. This had come
 as a shock since he had lived a charmed life. He hated that this was the truth and he struggled
 to be happy knowing that his assumptions weren't correct. He wouldn't realize until much later in life that the difficult 
obstacles he was facing that were taking away the beauty in his life at this moment would ultimately make his
 life much more beautiful. All he knew was that at this moment was that life isn't always beautiful. Hopes and 
dreams were dashed that day. It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock. The warning signs
 had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. That possibility had grown from 
hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came
 crashing down. The trail to the left had a "Danger! Do Not Pass" sign telling people to take the trail
 to the right. This wasn't the way Zeke approached his hiking. Rather than a warning, Zeke read the sign as
 an invitation to explore an area that would be adventurous and exciting. As the others in the group all shifted
 to the right, Zeke slipped past the danger sign to begin an adventure he would later regret. Trees. It was
 something about the trees. The way they swayed with the wind in unison. The way they shaded the area around
 them. The sounds of their leaves in the wind and the creaks from the branches as they sway, the beauty.

too bad of a workout”, bragged a third review. I thought I’d hike it when I fly in from Maryland 
on my day off from the senior citizen's wellness conference. I hiked 2 miles a day around the neighborhood so 
I could handle a 1.1-mile hike. What a foolish mistake that was for a 70-year-old low-lander. It's always good to
 bring a slower friend with you on a hike. If you happen to come across bears, the whole group doesn't 
have to worry. Only the slowest in the group do. That was the lesson they were about to learn today.
He stared out the window at the snowy field. He'd been stuck in the house for close to a month
 and his only view of the outside world was through the window. There wasn't much to see. It was mostly
 just the field with an occasional bird or small animal who ventured into the field. As he continued to stare
out the window, he wondered how much longer he'd be shackled to the steel bar inside the house. Life isn't
 always beautiful. That was a lesson that Dan was learning. He also realized that life wasn't easy. This had come
 as a shock since he had lived a charmed life. He hated that this was the truth and he struggled
 to be happy knowing that his assumptions weren't correct. He wouldn't realize until much later in life that the difficult 
obstacles he was facing that were taking away the beauty in his life at this moment would ultimately make his
 life much more beautiful. All he knew was that at this moment was that life isn't always beautiful. Hopes and 
dreams were dashed that day. It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock. The warning signs
 had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. That possibility had grown from 
hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came
 crashing down. The trail to the left had a "Danger! Do Not Pass" sign telling people to take the trail
 to the right. This wasn't the way Zeke approached his hiking. Rather than a warning, Zeke read the sign as
 an invitation to explore an area that would be adventurous and exciting. As the others in the group all shifted
 to the right, Zeke slipped past the danger sign to begin an adventure he would later regret. Trees. It was
 something about the trees. The way they swayed with the wind in unison. The way they shaded the area around
 them. The sounds of their leaves in the wind and the creaks from the branches as they sway, the beauty.

too bad of a workout”, bragged a third review. I thought I’d hike it when I fly in from Maryland 
on my day off from the senior citizen's wellness conference. I hiked 2 miles a day around the neighborhood so 
I could handle a 1.1-mile hike. What a foolish mistake that was for a 70-year-old low-lander. It's always good to
 bring a slower friend with you on a hike. If you happen to come across bears, the whole group doesn't 
have to worry. Only the slowest in the group do. That was the lesson they were about to learn today.
He stared out the window at the snowy field. He'd been stuck in the house for close to a month
 and his only view of the outside world was through the window. There wasn't much to see. It was mostly
 just the field with an occasional bird or small animal who ventured into the field. As he continued to stare
out the window, he wondered how much longer he'd be shackled to the steel bar inside the house. Life isn't
 always beautiful. That was a lesson that Dan was learning. He also realized that life wasn't easy. This had come
 as a shock since he had lived a charmed life. He hated that this was the truth and he struggled
 to be happy knowing that his assumptions weren't correct. He wouldn't realize until much later in life that the difficult 
obstacles he was facing that were taking away the beauty in his life at this moment would ultimately make his
 life much more beautiful. All he knew was that at this moment was that life isn't always beautiful. Hopes and 
dreams were dashed that day. It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock. The warning signs
 had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. That possibility had grown from 
hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came
 crashing down. The trail to the left had a "Danger! Do Not Pass" sign telling people to take the trail
 to the right. This wasn't the way Zeke approached his hiking. Rather than a warning, Zeke read the sign as
 an invitation to explore an area that would be adventurous and exciting. As the others in the group all shifted
 to the right, Zeke slipped past the danger sign to begin an adventure he would later regret. Trees. It was
 something about the trees. The way they swayed with the wind in unison. The way they shaded the area around
 them. The sounds of their leaves in the wind and the creaks from the branches as they sway, the beauty.

too bad of a workout”, bragged a third review. I thought I’d hike it when I fly in from Maryland 
on my day off from the senior citizen's wellness conference. I hiked 2 miles a day around the neighborhood so 
I could handle a 1.1-mile hike. What a foolish mistake that was for a 70-year-old low-lander. It's always good to
 bring a slower friend with you on a hike. If you happen to come across bears, the whole group doesn't 
have to worry. Only the slowest in the group do. That was the lesson they were about to learn today.
He stared out the window at the snowy field. He'd been stuck in the house for close to a month
 and his only view of the outside world was through the window. There wasn't much to see. It was mostly
 just the field with an occasional bird or small animal who ventured into the field. As he continued to stare
out the window, he wondered how much longer he'd be shackled to the steel bar inside the house. Life isn't
 always beautiful. That was a lesson that Dan was learning. He also realized that life wasn't easy. This had come
 as a shock since he had lived a charmed life. He hated that this was the truth and he struggled
 to be happy knowing that his assumptions weren't correct. He wouldn't realize until much later in life that the difficult 
obstacles he was facing that were taking away the beauty in his life at this moment would ultimately make his
 life much more beautiful. All he knew was that at this moment was that life isn't always beautiful. Hopes and 
dreams were dashed that day. It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock. The warning signs
 had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. That possibility had grown from 
hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came
 crashing down. The trail to the left had a "Danger! Do Not Pass" sign telling people to take the trail
 to the right. This wasn't the way Zeke approached his hiking. Rather than a warning, Zeke read the sign as
 an invitation to explore an area that would be adventurous and exciting. As the others in the group all shifted
 to the right, Zeke slipped past the danger sign to begin an adventure he would later regret. Trees. It was
 something about the trees. The way they swayed with the wind in unison. The way they shaded the area around
 them. The sounds of their leaves in the wind and the creaks from the branches as they sway, the beauty.

too bad of a workout”, bragged a third review. I thought I’d hike it when I fly in from Maryland 
on my day off from the senior citizen's wellness conference. I hiked 2 miles a day around the neighborhood so 
I could handle a 1.1-mile hike. What a foolish mistake that was for a 70-year-old low-lander. It's always good to
 bring a slower friend with you on a hike. If you happen to come across bears, the whole group doesn't 
have to worry. Only the slowest in the group do. That was the lesson they were about to learn today.
He stared out the window at the snowy field. He'd been stuck in the house for close to a month
 and his only view of the outside world was through the window. There wasn't much to see. It was mostly
 just the field with an occasional bird or small animal who ventured into the field. As he continued to stare
out the window, he wondered how much longer he'd be shackled to the steel bar inside the house. Life isn't
 always beautiful. That was a lesson that Dan was learning. He also realized that life wasn't easy. This had come
 as a shock since he had lived a charmed life. He hated that this was the truth and he struggled
 to be happy knowing that his assumptions weren't correct. He wouldn't realize until much later in life that the difficult 
obstacles he was facing that were taking away the beauty in his life at this moment would ultimately make his
 life much more beautiful. All he knew was that at this moment was that life isn't always beautiful. Hopes and 
dreams were dashed that day. It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock. The warning signs
 had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. That possibility had grown from 
hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came
 crashing down. The trail to the left had a "Danger! Do Not Pass" sign telling people to take the trail
 to the right. This wasn't the way Zeke approached his hiking. Rather than a warning, Zeke read the sign as
 an invitation to explore an area that would be adventurous and exciting. As the others in the group all shifted
 to the right, Zeke slipped past the danger sign to begin an adventure he would later regret. Trees. It was
 something about the trees. The way they swayed with the wind in unison. The way they shaded the area around
 them. The sounds of their leaves in the wind and the creaks from the branches as they sway, the beauty.

too bad of a workout”, bragged a third review. I thought I’d hike it when I fly in from Maryland 
on my day off from the senior citizen's wellness conference. I hiked 2 miles a day around the neighborhood so 
I could handle a 1.1-mile hike. What a foolish mistake that was for a 70-year-old low-lander. It's always good to
 bring a slower friend with you on a hike. If you happen to come across bears, the whole group doesn't

obstacles he was facing that were taking away the beauty in his life at this moment would ultimately make his
 life much more beautiful. All he knew was that at this moment was that life isn't always beautiful. Hopes and 
dreams were dashed that day. It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock. The warning signs
 had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. That possibility had grown from 
hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came
 crashing down. The trail to the left had a "Danger! Do Not Pass" sign telling people to take the trail
 to the right. This wasn't the way Zeke approached his hiking. Rather than a warning, Zeke read the sign as
 an invitation to explore an area that would be adventurous and exciting. As the others in the group all shifted
 to the right, Zeke slipped past the danger sign to begin an adventure he would later regret. Trees. It was
 something about the trees. The way they swayed with the wind in unison. The way they shaded the area around

bring plenty of water. “A beautiful hike to the clouds” described one review. “Not for the faint-hearted,” said another. “Not 
too bad of a workout”, bragged a third review. I thought I’d hike it when I fly in from Maryland 
on my day off from the senior citizen's wellness conference. I hiked 2 miles a day around the neighborhood so 
I could handle a 1.1-mile hike. What a foolish mistake that was for a 70-year-old low-lander. It's always good to
 bring a slower friend with you on a hike. If you happen to come across bears, the whole group doesn't 
have to worry. Only the slowest in the group do. That was the lesson they were about to learn today.
He stared out the window at the snowy field. He'd been stuck in the house for close to a month
 and his only view of the outside world was through the window. There wasn't much to see. It was mostly
 just the field with an occasional bird or small animal who ventured into the field. As he continued to stare
out the window, he wondered how much longer he'd be shackled to the steel bar inside the house. Life isn't
 always beautiful. That was a lesson that Dan was learning. He also realized that life wasn't easy. This had come
 as a shock since he had lived a charmed life. He hated that this was the truth and he struggled
 to be happy knowing that his assumptions weren't correct. He wouldn't realize until much later in life that the difficult 
obstacles he was facing that were taking away the beauty in his life at this moment would ultimately make his
 life much more beautiful. All he knew was that at this moment was that life isn't always beautiful. Hopes and 
dreams were dashed that day. It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock. The warning signs
 had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. That possibility had grown from 
hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came
 crashing down. The trail to the left had a "Danger! Do Not Pass" sign telling people to take the trail
 to the right. This wasn't the way Zeke approached his hiking. Rather than a warning, Zeke read the sign as
 an invitation to explore an area that would be adventurous and exciting. As the others in the group all shifted
 to the right, Zeke slipped past the danger sign to begin an adventure he would later regret. Trees. It was
 something about the trees. The way they swayed with the wind in unison. The way they shaded the area around
 them. The sounds of their leaves in the wind and the creaks from the branches as they sway, the beauty.

bring plenty of water. “A beautiful hike to the clouds” described one review. “Not for the faint-hearted,” said another. “Not 
too bad of a workout”, bragged a third review. I thought I’d hike it when I fly in from Maryland 
on my day off from the senior citizen's wellness conference. I hiked 2 miles a day around the neighborhood so 
I could handle a 1.1-mile hike. What a foolish mistake that was for a 70-year-old low-lander. It's always good to
 bring a slower friend with you on a hike. If you happen to come across bears, the whole group doesn't 
have to worry. Only the slowest in the group do. That was the lesson they were about to learn today.
He stared out the window at the snowy field. He'd been stuck in the house for close to a month
 and his only view of the outside world was through the window. There wasn't much to see. It was mostly
 just the field with an occasional bird or small animal who ventured into the field. As he continued to stare
out the window, he wondered how much longer he'd be shackled to the steel bar inside the house. Life isn't
 always beautiful. That was a lesson that Dan was learning. He also realized that life wasn't easy. This had come
 as a shock since he had lived a charmed life. He hated that this was the truth and he struggled
 to be happy knowing that his assumptions weren't correct. He wouldn't realize until much later in life that the difficult 
obstacles he was facing that were taking away the beauty in his life at this moment would ultimately make his
 life much more beautiful. All he knew was that at this moment was that life isn't always beautiful. Hopes and 
dreams were dashed that day. It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock. The warning signs
 had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. That possibility had grown from 
hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came
 crashing down. The trail to the left had a "Danger! Do Not Pass" sign telling people to take the trail
 to the right. This wasn't the way Zeke approached his hiking. Rather than a warning, Zeke read the sign as
 an invitation to explore an area that would be adventurous and exciting. As the others in the group all shifted
 to the right, Zeke slipped past the danger sign to begin an adventure he would later regret. Trees. It was
 something about the trees. The way they swayed with the wind in unison. The way they shaded the area around
 them. The sounds of their leaves in the wind and the creaks from the branches as they sway, the beauty.

bring plenty of water. “A beautiful hike to the clouds” described one review. “Not for the faint-hearted,” said another. “Not 
too bad of a workout”, bragged a third review. I thought I’d hike it when I fly in from Maryland 
on my day off from the senior citizen's wellness conference. I hiked 2 miles a day around the neighborhood so 
I could handle a 1.1-mile hike. What a foolish mistake that was for a 70-year-old low-lander. It's always good to
 bring a slower friend with you on a hike. If you happen to come across bears, the whole group doesn't 
have to worry. Only the slowest in the group do. That was the lesson they were about to learn today.
He stared out the window at the snowy field. He'd been stuck in the house for close to a month
 and his only view of the outside world was through the window. There wasn't much to see. It was mostly
 just the field with an occasional bird or small animal who ventured into the field. As he continued to stare
out the window, he wondered how much longer he'd be shackled to the steel bar inside the house. Life isn't
 always beautiful. That was a lesson that Dan was learning. He also realized that life wasn't easy. This had come
 as a shock since he had lived a charmed life. He hated that this was the truth and he struggled
 to be happy knowing that his assumptions weren't correct. He wouldn't realize until much later in life that the difficult 
obstacles he was facing that were taking away the beauty in his life at this moment would ultimately make his
 life much more beautiful. All he knew was that at this moment was that life isn't always beautiful. Hopes and 
dreams were dashed that day. It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock. The warning signs
 had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. That possibility had grown from 
hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came
 crashing down. The trail to the left had a "Danger! Do Not Pass" sign telling people to take the trail
 to the right. This wasn't the way Zeke approached his hiking. Rather than a warning, Zeke read the sign as
 an invitation to explore an area that would be adventurous and exciting. As the others in the group all shifted
 to the right, Zeke slipped past the danger sign to begin an adventure he would later regret. Trees. It was
 something about the trees. The way they swayed with the wind in unison. The way they shaded the area around
 them. The sounds of their leaves in the wind and the creaks from the branches as they sway, the beauty.

bring plenty of water. “A beautiful hike to the clouds” described one review. “Not for the faint-hearted,” said another. “Not 
too bad of a workout”, bragged a third review. I thought I’d hike it when I fly in from Maryland 
on my day off from the senior citizen's wellness conference. I hiked 2 miles a day around the neighborhood so 
I could handle a 1.1-mile hike. What a foolish mistake that was for a 70-year-old low-lander. It's always good to
 bring a slower friend with you on a hike. If you happen to come across bears, the whole group doesn't 
have to worry. Only the slowest in the group do. That was the lesson they were about to learn today.
He stared out the window at the snowy field. He'd been stuck in the house for close to a month
 and his only view of the outside world was through the window. There wasn't much to see. It was mostly
 just the field with an occasional bird or small animal who ventured into the field. As he continued to stare
out the window, he wondered how much longer he'd be shackled to the steel bar inside the house. Life isn't
 always beautiful. That was a lesson that Dan was learning. He also realized that life wasn't easy. This had come
 as a shock since he had lived a charmed life. He hated that this was the truth and he struggled
 to be happy knowing that his assumptions weren't correct. He wouldn't realize until much later in life that the difficult 
obstacles he was facing that were taking away the beauty in his life at this moment would ultimately make his
 life much more beautiful. All he knew was that at this moment was that life isn't always beautiful. Hopes and 
dreams were dashed that day. It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock. The warning signs
 had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. That possibility had grown from 
hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came
 crashing down. The trail to the left had a "Danger! Do Not Pass" sign telling people to take the trail
 to the right. This wasn't the way Zeke approached his hiking. Rather than a warning, Zeke read the sign as
 an invitation to explore an area that would be adventurous and exciting. As the others in the group all shifted
 to the right, Zeke slipped past the danger sign to begin an adventure he would later regret. Trees. It was
 something about the trees. The way they swayed with the wind in unison. The way they shaded the area around
 them. The sounds of their leaves in the wind and the creaks from the branches as they sway, the beauty.

bring plenty of water. “A beautiful hike to the clouds” described one review. “Not for the faint-hearted,” said another. “Not 
too bad of a workout”, bragged a third review. I thought I’d hike it when I fly in from Maryland 
on my day off from the senior citizen's wellness conference. I hiked 2 miles a day around the neighborhood so 
I could handle a 1.1-mile hike. What a foolish mistake that was for a 70-year-old low-lander. It's always good to
 bring a slower friend with you on a hike. If you happen to come across bears, the whole group doesn't 
have to worry. Only the slowest in the group do. That was the lesson they were about to learn today.
He stared out the window at the snowy field. He'd been stuck in the house for close to a month
 and his only view of the outside world was through the window. There wasn't much to see. It was mostly
 just the field with an occasional bird or small animal who ventured into the field. As he continued to stare
out the window, he wondered how much longer he'd be shackled to the steel bar inside the house. Life isn't
 always beautiful. That was a lesson that Dan was learning. He also realized that life wasn't easy. This had come
 as a shock since he had lived a charmed life. He hated that this was the truth and he struggled
 to be happy knowing that his assumptions weren't correct. He wouldn't realize until much later in life that the difficult 
obstacles he was facing that were taking away the beauty in his life at this moment would ultimately make his
 life much more beautiful. All he knew was that at this moment was that life isn't always beautiful. Hopes and 
dreams were dashed that day. It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock. The warning signs
 had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. That possibility had grown from 
hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came
 crashing down. The trail to the left had a "Danger! Do Not Pass" sign telling people to take the trail
 to the right. This wasn't the way Zeke approached his hiking. Rather than a warning, Zeke read the sign as
 an invitation to explore an area that would be adventurous and exciting. As the others in the group all shifted
 to the right, Zeke slipped past the danger sign to begin an adventure he would later regret. Trees. It was
 something about the trees. The way they swayed with the wind in unison. The way they shaded the area around
 them. The sounds of their leaves in the wind and the creaks from the branches as they sway, the beauty.

bring plenty of water. “A beautiful hike to the clouds” described one review. “Not for the faint-hearted,” said another. “Not 
too bad of a workout”, bragged a third review. I thought I’d hike it when I fly in from Maryland 
on my day off from the senior citizen's wellness conference. I hiked 2 miles a day around the neighborhood so 
I could handle a 1.1-mile hike. What a foolish mistake that was for a 70-year-old low-lander. It's always good to
 bring a slower friend with you on a hike. If you happen to come across bears, the whole group doesn't 
have to worry. Only the slowest in the group do. That was the lesson they were about to learn today.
He stared out the window at the snowy field. He'd been stuck in the house for close to a month
 and his only view of the outside world was through the window. There wasn't much to see. It was mostly
 just the field with an occasional bird or small animal who ventured into the field. As he continued to stare
out the window, he wondered how much longer he'd be shackled to the steel bar inside the house. Life isn't
 always beautiful. That was a lesson that Dan was learning. He also realized that life wasn't easy. This had come
 as a shock since he had lived a charmed life. He hated that this was the truth and he struggled
 to be happy knowing that his assumptions weren't correct. He wouldn't realize until much later in life that the difficult 
obstacles he was facing that were taking away the beauty in his life at this moment would ultimately make his
 life much more beautiful. All he knew was that at this moment was that life isn't always beautiful. Hopes and 
dreams were dashed that day. It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock. The warning signs
 had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. That possibility had grown from 
hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came
 crashing down. The trail to the left had a "Danger! Do Not Pass" sign telling people to take the trail
 to the right. This wasn't the way Zeke approached his hiking. Rather than a warning, Zeke read the sign as
 an invitation to explore an area that would be adventurous and exciting. As the others in the group all shifted
 to the right, Zeke slipped past the danger sign to begin an adventure he would later regret. Trees. It was
 something about the trees. The way they swayed with the wind in unison. The way they shaded the area around
 them. The sounds of their leaves in the wind and the creaks from the branches as they sway, the beauty.
